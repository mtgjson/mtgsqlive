### Goals
The goals of this project are to extend the MTGJSONv4 protocols and give an option for pre-processed SQLite downloads.
lly edit it to be correct. Once that is accomplished, we are then no longer dependent on them for card data, except for rullings.

# About Us

MTGJSON and MTGSQlive are open sourced database creation and distribution tool for [*Magic: The Gathering*](https://magic.wizards.com/) cards, specifically in [JSON](https://json.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) format.

You can find our documentation with all properties [here](https://mtgjson.com/docs.html).

To provide feedback and/or bug reports, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgsqlite/issues/new/) as it is the best way for us to communicate with the public.

If you would like to join or assist the development of the project, you can [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/Hgyg7GJ) to discuss things further.

# How To Use

>**Note:** These are the build directions to compile your own SQLite file.<br>
>If you are looking for the pre-compiled SQLite file, you can download it from [MTGJSON.com](https://mtgjson.com/).

This system was built using *Python 3.7*, so we can only guarantee proper functionality with this version.



```sh
# Install dependencies
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

# usage: mtgsqlive [-h] -i file -o file 
$ python3 -m mtgsqlive -i /path/to/AllSets.json -o /path/to/output.sqlite

```
